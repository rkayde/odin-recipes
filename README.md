# odin-recipes
This is the README file for Project: Recipes, which is a project-based learning experience offered by The Odin Project.
Skills I've put into use so far include: 
Using the command line to create directories including the one storing this file
Creating a repo on Github
Cloning the repo to my local machine
...And more, which I'll be demonstrating (hopefully) with this website
